# Classes

Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new *type* of object, allowing new *instances* of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.

<p>Compared with other programming languages, Python’s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics. It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.</p>

<p>In C++ terminology, normally class members (including the data members) are <em>public</em> (except see below [Private Variables](#tut-private)), and all member functions are <em>virtual</em>. As in Modula-3, there are no shorthands for referencing the object’s members from its methods: the method function is declared with an explicit first argument representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call. As in Smalltalk, classes themselves are objects. This provides semantics for importing and renaming. Unlike C++ and Modula-3, built-in types can be used as base classes for extension by the user. Also, like in C++, most built-in operators with special syntax (arithmetic operators, subscripting etc.) can be redefined for class instances.</p>

<p>(Lacking universally accepted terminology to talk about classes, I will make occasional use of Smalltalk and C++ terms. I would use Modula-3 terms, since its object-oriented semantics are closer to those of Python than C++, but I expect that few readers have heard of it.)</p>
# Python Namespace and Scoping Overview

Python's namespace system organizes variables and other identifiers into scopes, allowing for modular code organization. Here's a breakdown of how namespaces work in Python:

## Basic Namespace Structure
- **Global Scope**: The outermost scope where variables are accessible across the module.
- **Local Scope**: Defined by function or class definitions, containing local variables.
- **Non-local Variables**: Accessible from enclosing scopes using the `nonlocal` keyword.
- **Class Scope**: Each class creates a new namespace, accessible within its methods.

## Scope Resolution Order
When looking up a variable:
1. Check the innermost (local) scope first.
2. Move outward through nested functions or classes.
3. Access module-level (global) variables.
4. Finally, check the built-in names in the global scope.

## Example: Variable Accessibility
```python
def outer():
    x = 10
    def inner():
        print(x)  # Uses outer's x
    return inner

func = outer()
func()  # Prints 10
```

## Special Cases
- **Global Variables**: Declared with `global` keyword to modify module-level variables.
- **Non-local Variables**: Access or rebind variables from enclosing scopes using `nonlocal`.

## Class Namespace Example
```python
class MyClass:
    x = 5  # Class-level variable

def my_func():
    print(MyClass.x)  # Accesses class-level x
```

## Dynamic vs. Static Scoping
- Python historically uses dynamic scoping, but local variables are resolved statically at compile time.
- This distinction is important for optimization and potential future changes in Python.

By understanding these concepts, you can better organize and manage your code's namespace structure in Python.
